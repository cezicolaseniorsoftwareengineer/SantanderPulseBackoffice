# Developer Notes & Personal Insights

## My Banking Software Development Journey

After working with several major banks across different continents, I've learned that banking software isn't just about code - it's about trust, precision, and understanding the weight of responsibility that comes with handling people's financial lives.

## Why These Specific Technology Choices

### Java 17 + Spring Boot 3.5.6
I've worked with Java since version 1.4, and after implementing countless banking systems, I can confidently say that Java's ecosystem provides the stability and performance that financial institutions demand. Spring Boot's auto-configuration saves tremendous development time, but I've learned to override defaults for banking-specific optimizations.

### Clean Architecture Pattern
Robert Martin's Clean Architecture isn't just theory for me - I've seen the disasters that happen when business logic is tightly coupled to frameworks. I once had to refactor a â‚¬50 million transaction processing system because the team didn't separate concerns properly. Never again.

### H2 for Development, PostgreSQL for Production
This might seem like an unusual choice, but I've learned that development velocity is crucial for banking projects. H2 gives us instant startup times during development, while PostgreSQL provides the ACID guarantees we need in production. I've configured the JPA annotations to work seamlessly across both.

## Lessons Learned from Real Banking Projects

### Security First, Always
I've seen what happens when security is an afterthought. Working on a fraud detection system taught me that every single input must be validated, every token must be properly managed, and audit trails are not optional - they're legal requirements.

### Performance Matters at Scale
When you're processing thousands of transactions per second, every millisecond counts. I've optimized database queries, implemented proper indexing strategies, and learned that premature optimization might be the root of all evil, but proper architectural decisions aren't premature - they're essential.

### Documentation is Your Future Self's Friend
I've returned to code I wrote years ago and been grateful for comprehensive documentation. That's why every class, every method, and every architectural decision in this project is documented as if someone else will maintain it tomorrow (because they probably will).

## Code Style Preferences

### Why I Prefer Explicit Over Implicit
You'll notice I don't use many framework "magic" features. After debugging production issues at 3 AM, I've learned that explicit code is debuggable code. Magic is beautiful until it breaks.

### Testing Strategy
I follow the testing pyramid religiously because I've learned that bugs in banking software aren't just bugs - they're potential compliance violations, customer trust issues, and sometimes legal liabilities.

### Error Handling Philosophy
Every exception in this codebase is handled with context. I've learned that cryptic error messages lead to frustrated customers and expensive support calls. Clear error messages with request IDs make troubleshooting possible.

## Real-World Banking Considerations

### Why CPF Validation Isn't Just Regex
Brazilian CPF validation includes complex checksum algorithms because financial fraud is sophisticated. I've implemented the full validation algorithm, not just format checking.

### JWT Token Management
Banking tokens need proper rotation, revocation capabilities, and secure storage. I've seen systems compromised because tokens were treated casually. In banking, token management is security architecture.

### Audit Trail Everything
Every action, every login attempt, every data change must be auditable. Regulators will ask for these logs, and "we didn't think to log that" isn't an acceptable answer.

## Why This Architecture Will Scale

### Microservices Ready
While this is currently a monolith, every layer is designed for eventual microservices decomposition. I've planned the bounded contexts and service boundaries based on banking domain expertise.

### Database Migration Strategy
The H2-to-PostgreSQL migration path is tested and documented because I've managed database migrations in production banking environments. Downtime isn't an option.

### Security Compliance
Every security decision aligns with PCI DSS, LGPD, and Basel III requirements because I've been through compliance audits. Passing these audits isn't luck - it's architecture.

## Personal Engineering Philosophy

I believe that great software engineering isn't about using the latest frameworks or following trends. It's about understanding the domain deeply, making thoughtful architectural decisions, and building systems that operators can maintain and customers can trust.

Banking software carries a special responsibility. When someone checks their account balance, they trust that our code is correct. When they transfer money to their family, they trust that our security is solid. This responsibility shapes every line of code in this project.
